# m1-hw1-bazail-briana

I did not have any issues with this assignment until the very end. I had issues merging the content-test into my master branch. Atom kept alerting me to "pick" which version to commit before merging. It was the first time I had ever seen something like that. My second issue was when I had to push to the repo. An error kept showing up with this message: 

remote: Permission to brianabazail/m1-hw1-bazail-briana.git denied to brianasbazail.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/brianabazail/m1-hw1-bazail-briana.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

I was able to upload the file directly to GitHub but need to figure out why I am constantly getting this error. 

No outside resources were used.
